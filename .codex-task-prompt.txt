Continue VK task c585580b-d912-407c-b0e4-776dad3a3c91.

Goals:
1) Investigate and document exact root cause of PR89 invalid content merge.
2) Patch automation scripts so:
   - VK sections are updated structurally (no blind bottom append)
   - timeline includes full lifecycle events with seconds
   - updater scripts never add/remove/move 🧀
3) Implement actual Playwright fixes for the reported failures.
4) Run full gates including bun run e2e.
5) Push branch and run /usr/local/bin/openclaw-codex-handoff.sh to open corrective PR (expected PR #90 next).

Hard constraints:
- Do NOT create/edit/merge PR manually with gh.
- Update VK checkboxes live across Acceptance/Gates/Progress.
- Keep task description rich; do not drop sections.
- Keep links as full visible URLs in PR/VK fields.

Validation commands required:
- bun run lint
- bun test
- bun run build
- bun run e2e

At completion:
- Ensure task timeline has: worktree/branch prepared, commit created+pushed, status transitions, PR opened, labels applied.
- Append concise root-cause note in Notes.
- Push changes, then run handoff script.
