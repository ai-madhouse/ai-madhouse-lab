Continue this vibe-kanban task (id: b69d57af-12c7-46b7-af2d-c80fb413259e): fix(e2e): resolve windows teardown EBUSY + locale-stable auth selectors; enforce tmp cleanup

Read AGENTS.md from repo root in this worktree and follow it as authoritative.

Task description:
## Goal
- Fix the reported Playwright failures from the provided error log.
- Ensure `bun run e2e` passes end-to-end for this task scope.
- Ensure no `/tmp` directory remains after e2e completes (not only `/tmp/e2e/*`).

## Context
- Reported failure #1 (Windows teardown):
  - `EBUSY: resource busy or locked, unlink ... tmp/e2e/<run>/app.db` in `e2e/global-teardown.ts` on `rmSync(tmpDir, { recursive: true, force: true })`.
- Reported failure #2 (locale-sensitive selector):
  - `e2e/ui-regressions.spec.ts` fails at RU locale timeout waiting for `getByLabel('Username')` in `e2e/helpers.ts`.
- Requested execution target:
  - Validate with full `bun run e2e` (not subset).

## Approach
- Reproduce both failures and identify lock holder/order-of-shutdown in teardown path.
- Implement focused teardown hardening that releases holders before deletion (retries only as safety net).
- Replace locale-sensitive auth selectors with stable selectors where needed.
- Keep changes minimal and avoid unrelated refactors.

## Acceptance
- [ ] `bun run e2e` passes fully in this branch.
- [ ] Teardown no longer fails with `EBUSY` in the reported path.
- [ ] Auth/register flow is locale-stable (including RU) and no longer depends on English-only labels.
- [ ] No `/tmp` directory remains after e2e completion.
- [ ] Root cause summary and verification evidence are documented in task notes.

## Gates
- [ ] bun run lint
- [ ] bun test
- [ ] bun run build
- [ ] bun run e2e

## Notes
- Deliverables expected from implementation:
  - Code changes.
  - Short root-cause summary for both failures.
  - Exact command outputs for lint/test/build/e2e.
  - Explicit post-run confirmation that `/tmp` was removed.
- PR/task hygiene:
  - Codex must NOT create/edit/merge PRs manually.
  - Use automation-owned handoff after push: `/usr/local/bin/openclaw-codex-handoff.sh`.
  - Update checklist incrementally in real time across ALL three sections: Acceptance, Gates, Progress.
  - Never revert completed `[x]` back to `[ ]`.

Constraints:
- Work only in this worktree/branch.
- Do NOT push.
- One commit then stop.
- Do NOT create or edit PRs manually; automation owns PR creation/title/body/labels.
- Update checklist incrementally in real time across ALL three sections (Progress, Acceptance, Gates): as soon as any specific item is verified complete, mark only that exact item [x] immediately.
- Never uncheck completed items.
- Run bun run lint && bun test && bun run build && bun run e2e before finalizing.
- When implementation + gates are complete, run /usr/local/bin/openclaw-codex-handoff.sh right after push for automation-owned PR handoff.
