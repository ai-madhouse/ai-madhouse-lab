## Edge cases
- Notes history POST now accepts `null` for optional request fields (`note_id`, `target_event_id`, `payload_iv`, `payload_ciphertext`) and relies on existing semantic checks to enforce required values per event kind.
- This matches the UI payload shape, which serializes missing optional values as `null`.

## Risks / Follow-ups
- The change is schema-level only; persistence behavior is unchanged (`null` is still written for absent optional columns).
- If stricter API contracts are desired later, consider normalizing the client payload to omit optional keys instead of sending `null`.
