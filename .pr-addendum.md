## Edge cases
- Local development served from IPv6 loopback (`http://[::1]:<port>`) now resolves realtime websocket URL to `ws://[::1]:8787/ws` instead of same-origin `/ws`, preventing unauthorized upgrades caused by host-only auth cookies.
- Dashboard realtime status no longer flips to disconnected on a standalone websocket `error` event; disconnected state is now driven by `close`, which matches actual transport teardown and avoids transient false negatives.
